# Passwords

This table lists the passwords for the services that have "fixed" userids and passwords.

|Service|Userid|Password
|-------|------|--------|
|Virtual Machine|watsonx|watsonx.data
|Virtual Machine|root|watsonx.data
|watsonx.data UI|ibmlhadmin|password
|Jupyter Notebook|none|watsonx.data
|Presto|ibmlhadmin|password
|Minio|Generated|Generated
|Postgres|admin|Generated
|Apache Superset|admin|admin
|Portainer|admin|watsonx.data
|Db2|db2inst1|db2inst1
|MySQL|root|password
|Milvus|ibmlhadmin|password
|SSH Browser|watsonx|watsonx.data

Use the following commands to get the generated userid and password for MinIO.
```
export LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY | sed 's/.*=//')
export LH_S3_SECRET_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_SECRET_KEY | sed 's/.*=//')
echo "MinIO Userid  : " $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY
echo "MinIO Password: " $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY
```

Use the following command to get the password for Postgres.
```
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(docker exec ibm-lh-postgres printenv | grep POSTGRES_PASSWORD | sed 's/.*=//')
echo "Postgres Userid   : admin"
echo "Postgres Password : " $POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

You can get all passwords for the system when you are logged by issuing the following command:
```bash
cat /certs/passwords
```

If the passwords do not appear to work, you may need to regenerate them. The following must be run as the `root` user.

```bash
sudo su -
passwords
```

The `passwords` command will refresh the passwords and also display them. If this command is not run as root, an error message will be displayed because the password file cannot be updated as the `watsonx` user.

## Watsonx.data Connection Certificate

When connecting to the watsonx.data Presto database, you will need to have the connection certificate available to the client that you are using. Usually this location is your workstation, but it could be another service like CP4D.

To extract the certificate to your local file system, use the following command in a terminal window. Replace the `port` and `region.services.cloud.techzone.ibm.com` with the SSH values found in the TechZone reservation.

```
scp -P port watsonx@region.services.cloud.techzone.ibm.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads
```

Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! 

You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Credentials notebook. There you will find links to the certificates.

If you need to generate the certificate, you can use the following commands from within a local terminal session:

#### Generate Certificate

This command will generate a certificate called `presto.crt`. You can print the contents of the file and use that for input into CP4D dialogs that require the certificate text.

```
rm -f presto.crt
echo QUIT | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect localhost:8443 | awk '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/ {p=1}; p; /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ {p=0}' > presto.crt
cat presto.crt
```

#### Generate Java Key Store

The following command will require a password for the keystore. The password can be anything you want, but it is set to `watsonx.data` in the Developer Edition. You must also accept the list of DNS names that are displayed in the list. The default is no! The keystore that is created is called `presto-key.jks`. 

```
rm -f presto-key.jks
keytool -import -alias presto-cert -file ./presto.cert -keystore ./presto-key.jks

```

# Acknowledgments
We would like to thank all the development team for helping to deliver this
release given the tremendous deadlines and constraints that they have been
under. The initial lab was created by Deepak Rangarao with contributions from
development. Additional material was supplied by Daniel Hancock and feedback
from the members of the watsonx.data activation community. Formatting and
script development was done by George Baklarz. 

The contents of this eBook are
the result of a lot of research and testing based on the contents of 
watsonx.data. Results are based on a specific version of watsonx.data, so you
may have different results if using an older or newer version of the development
kit.

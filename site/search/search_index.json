In order to access these images outside the Virtual machine image, you need the server name and port for the service. You will also need to download the presto-key.jks file for connecting to Presto. Connection Certificate Accessing watsonx.data (Presto) Accessing Db2 Accessing PostgreSQL Accessing MySQL Adding a database to watsonx.data Accessing watsonx.data via Python Accessing watsonx.data via Pandas Dataframes Generating a Certificate Watsonx.data Connection Certificate When connecting to the watsonx.data Presto database, you will need to have the connection certificate available to the client that you are using. Usually this location is your workstation, but it could be another service like CP4D. To extract the certificate to your local file system, use the following command in a terminal window. Replace the port and regions.techzone-server.com with the SSH values found in the TechZone reservation. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Credentials notebook. There you will find links to the certificates. Watsonx.data Presto Access When connecting to the Presto engine, choose the PrestoDB driver. Presto Internal Access For local access the following credentials are used: Hostname: localhost Port: 8443 Username: ibmlhadmin Password: password Database: tpch In addition, you need to set the following driver properties: SSL True SSLTrustStorePath /certs/presto-key.jks SSLTrustStorePassword watsonx.data Presto External Access The watsonx.data Presto database requires that the certificate be extracted from the image. See the section above on Connection Certificate for more details. In the following settings, remember to update the Hostname and Port to the values provided in your TechZone reservation. The database connection settings are: Hostname: region.techzone-server.com Port: port Username: ibmlhadmin Password: password Database: tpch In addition, you need to set the following driver properties: SSL True SSLTrustStorePath /mydownload/presto-key.jks SSLTrustStorePassword watsonx.data Note : The /mydownload/presto-key.jks value needs to be replaced with the location that you copied the key in the earlier step. Db2 Access When connecting to the Db2 engine, select the Db2 LUW driver. Db2 Internal Access The Db2 server can be accessed on port 50000 inside the virtual machine using the following credentials: Hostname - watsonxdata Port - 50000 Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off Db2 External Access When accessing the database outside the virtual machine, you must change the host to region.techzone-server.com and the port number based on your TechZone reservation. All the other settings remain the same. Hostname - region.techzone-server.com Port - port Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off PostgreSQL Access When connecting to the PostgreSQL engine, select the PostgreSQL driver. In order to connect to the PostgreSQL system, you will need to extract the admin password using the following command when connected to the watsonx.data system. cat /certs/passwords You can also retrieve the credentials by opening up the Credentials notebook in the Jupyter notebook service. PostgreSQL Internal Access When accessing the PostgreSQL database in the system, use the following settings. Hostname \u2013 ibm-lh-postgres Port \u2013 5432 Username \u2013 admin Password \u2013 The value that was extracted in the earlier step Database \u2013 gosales PostgreSQL External Access The following credentials are used for remote access. Hostname: regions.techzone-server.com Port: port Username: admin Password: The value that was extracted in the earlier step Database name: gosales MySQL Access When connecting to the MySQL engine, select the MySQL driver. export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(docker exec ibm-lh-postgres printenv | grep POSTGRES_PASSWORD | sed 's/.*=//') echo \"Postgres Userid : admin\" echo \"Postgres Password : \" $POSTGRES_PASSWORD echo $POSTGRES_PASSWORD > /tmp/postgres.pw MySQL Internal Access When accessing the MySQL database in the system, use the following settings. Hostname \u2013 watsonxdata Port \u2013 3306 Username \u2013 root Password - password Database \u2013 gosalesdw You must set the allowPublicKeyRetrieval to True for the connection to work with dBeaver. MySQL External Access The following credentials are used for remote access. Hostname: regions.techzone-server.com Port: port Username: root Password - password Database name: gosalesdw You must set the allowPublicKeyRetrieval to True for the connection to work with dBeaver (see above). Adding a Database to watsonx.data When adding a database engine to the watsonx.data system, make sure to change the database display name since that needs to be unique. For instance, when you add gosales database from Db2 to the system, the display name could be gosales as well. However, if you now add the PostgreSQL database to the system, the display name cannot be the same. You may want to differentiate databases with the same name by prefixing them with the database type. For instance, the gosales database could be shown as db2_gosales or pg_gosales so that you keep the names distinct. Once a database has been added, make sure to wait for a few moments before attempting to access the database. The Presto server takes a few moments to start up. To make sure that it is running, run the check_presto command in a terminal window and wait until it says the service is ready. When attempting to view the contents of a new database, the process may take a few minutes to complete. Refresh the browser window if you haven't seen any changes to the display. Accessing watsonx.data via Python In order to access the watsonx.data database (Presto), you will need to install the Presto client using the following command on your local machine. pip3 install presto-python-client Once the installation is complete, extract the certificate from the watsonx.data server that we will use in the connection. scp -P port watsonx@region.techzone-server.com:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! You can also download the certificate by using the Jupyter Notebook link and opening the Certificate notebook. Python and Jupyter Connection Code Your Python or Jupyter notebook code will need to import the prestodb library and then connect to watsonx.data using the connect call. import prestodb conn = prestodb.dbapi.connect( host='watsonxdata', port=8443, user='ibmlhadmin', catalog='tpch', schema='tiny', http_scheme='https', auth=prestodb.auth.BasicAuthentication(\"ibmlhadmin\", \"password\") ) conn._http_session.verify = '/certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt' cur = conn.cursor() In the above connection string, you will need to replace the following values: host - watsonxdata when connecting to the image externally, and ibm-lh-presto-svc when connecting internally catalog - What is the name of the catalog that we are accessing schema - The schema inside the catalog that will be used You also need to update the conn._http_session.verify value with the location where you downloaded the lh-ssl-ts.crt file. For internal connections, this value will be /certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt . Once connected, you can run an SQL statement and return the results. cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.customer\") rows = cur.fetchall() The rows variable contains the answer set from the select statement. You can manipulate the row variable to view the results. rows[0] [1, 'Customer#000000001', 'IVhzIApeRb ot,c,E', 15, '25-989-741-2988', 711.56, 'BUILDING', 'to the even, regular platelets. regular, ironic epitaphs nag e'] The PrestoDB driver supports the DBAPI spec.

Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system). You should see the current buckets in MinIO. If you don't see the buckets, click on Object Browser on the left-hand side panel. Select hive-bucket from the list of buckets. You may see other directories in this list than what is shown above. You will need to create a new path for your data set. Create a new directory name for your data (fuel_economy was used for this example). MinIO will display an empty directory and suggest you load something into it. Use the Upload button on the far right side to point to your dataset on your local machine. In this example, we are using a CSV file for the 2013 fuel economy estimates for automobiles sold in the US. You may need to rename you datasets to eliminate blanks and any other special characters other than \" _ \" or \" - \". The display will show the progress of the upload into the bucket. You may need to refresh your browser to see the file in the bucket. Now that the data has been loaded into a bucket, you can catalog it in the watsonx.data UI. If you created a new bucket for this data set, you will need to register it first in the watsonx.data UI. Instructions for how to do this are found in the Working with Object Store Buckets section. Start by navigating to the watsonx.data UI and look at the Infrastructure manager. Find the bucket where you upload your data set into and note the catalog name that it is associated with. Here we can see that the hive-bucket bucket is associated with the hive_data catalog. In the watsonx.data UI, select the Query workspace (SQL) icon. You will need to create a schema that links to this data set. The format of the command is shown below. DROP SCHEMA catalog.schema_name; CREATE SCHEMA catalog.schema_name WITH ( location = 's3a://your-bucket/data_directory' ); You will need to change the following values: catalog - The catalog that the bucket you are using is associated with schema_name - A schema name to associate your tables with data_directory - The directory in which your file is located your_bucket - The bucket the data physically resides in For the fuel economy example, using mpg as the schema, the SQL would be: DROP SCHEMA hive_data.mpg; CREATE SCHEMA hive_data.mpg WITH ( location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Run this SQL against the Presto engine: The DROP command may fail if the schema doesn't exist, but the CREATE should work. The next step is to define what the table looks like for watsonx.data to be able to query it. The syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is similar to: CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.tablename ( \"column_name\" \"type\", ... ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://your_bucket/data_directory'); You will need to create a table definition for your CSV file in order to catalog it in watsonx.data. Note that the only data type that is permitted for CSV columns is varchar . This is a restriction of the current driver. Plans are to update it to include other data types over time. If your data set does not include a header row (a row that defines the column names), you will need to create the table definition manually. If the data set does contain a header record, you can use the following Python code to generate a CREATE TABLE statement. You will need to make sure that pandas is available. python3 -m pip install pandas --user Next run the python3 command in the shell to run an interactive Python session. python3 Place the following code into your Python window. def showcsv(catalog, schema, tablename, bucket, directory, csv_in): import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(csv_in,na_values=\"-\") df = df.fillna(0) column_headers = list(df.columns.values) print(\"\") print(f\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename};\") print(f\"CREATE TABLE {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename}\") print(\" (\") comma = \"\" end = \"\" for header in column_headers: print(f\"{comma}\",end=end) comma = \",\" end = \"\\n\" print(f' \"{header}\" varchar',end=\"\") print(f\" )\") print(f\"WITH (\") print(f\" format = 'CSV',\") print(f\" csv_separator = ',',\") print(f\" external_location = 's3a://{bucket}/{directory}'\") print(f\" );\") print(\"\") def makesql(): catalog = input(\"Catalog : \") schema = input(\"Schema : \") table = input(\"Table : \") bucket = input(\"Bucket : \") dir = input(\"Directory : \") csv = input(\"CSV File : \") showcsv(catalog,schema,table,bucket,dir,csv) Gather the following information on your dataset: catalog - The catalog the schema and table are created under ( hive_data ) schema - The schema name that you created to hold your table ( mpg ) table name - The name of the table ( fuel_economy ) bucket - Where the data is located ( hive-bucket ) directory - What directory contains your data ( fuel_economy ) csv_in - The location on your local machine where the csv file is Once you have gathered that, run the following command in your Python window and answer the prompts. makesql() >>> makesql() Catalog : hive_data Schema : mpg Table : fueleconomy Bucket : hive-bucket Directory : fuel_economy CSV File : ~/Downloads/fuel_economy_2013.csv DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy; CREATE TABLE hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy ( \"MODEL_YEAR\" varchar, \"MFR_NAME\" varchar, \"DIVISION\" varchar, \"CARLINE\" varchar, \"ENG_DISPL\" varchar, \"CYL\" varchar, \"TRANS_IN_FE_GUIDE\" varchar, \"CITY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"HWY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"COMB_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"AIR_ASPIRATION_DESC\" varchar, \"TRANS_DESC\" varchar, \"GEARS\" varchar, \"DRIVE_DESC\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_DESC_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"ANNUAL_FUEL_COST_CONVENTIONAL\" varchar, \"FUEL_METERING_SYS_DESC\" varchar ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Cut and paste the output from the command into the watsonx.data Data Explorer window to create the file.

Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. It is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple pie charts to highly detailed geospatial charts. Application Programming Interface (API)**: Application Programming Interface (API) is a programmatic interface for executing functions of an application in an automated or manual fashion without using a CLI or User Interface. Buckets : Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets. Catalog : This term may have many meanings depending on context. Review below: Service Catalog - A service catalog is a comprehensive list of cloud computing services that an organization offers its customers. The catalog is the only portion of the company's service portfolio that is published and provided to customers as a support to the sale or delivery of offered services. Data Catalog - A collection of business information describing the available datasets within an organization. Metastore Catalog - A collection of technical and operational metadata allowing a query engine to overlay a virtual table on a collection of discrete data files. Connector Catalog - The named representation of a connector within the virtual warehouse of a presto instance. Command Line Interface (CLI) : A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. dBeaver : DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. For relational databases it uses the JDBC application programming interface to interact with databases via a JDBC driver. For other databases it uses proprietary database drivers. Federation : A federated database is a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one. MinIO : MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It runs on-prem and on any cloud (public or private) and from the data center to the edge. MinIO is software-defined and open source under GNU AGPL v3. Object Storage : Object storage is a data storage architecture for storing unstructured data, which sections data into units\u2014objects\u2014and stores them in a structurally flat data environment. Each object includes the data, metadata, and a unique identifier that applications can use for easy access and retrieval. Presto : Presto is a distributed database query engine (written in Java) that uses the SQL query language. Its architecture allows users to query data sources such as Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka, AWS S3, Alluxio, MySQL, MongoDB and Teradata, and allows use of multiple data sources within a query. Presto is community-driven open-source software released under the Apache License. Presto's architecture is very similar to other database management systems using cluster computing, sometimes called massively parallel processing (MPP). SPARK : Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark can be used with watsonx.data but is not included in the watsonsx.data environment image provided. TechZone (IBM Technology Zone) : IBM Technology Zone is the platform where the developer edition of watsonx.data with the sample data sets has been provisioned. Generally, it allows Go To Market teams and Business Partners to easily build technical 'Show Me' live environments, POTs, prototypes, and MVPs, which can then be customized and shared with peers and customers to experience IBM Technology. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) : VNC is a cross-platform screen-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol. VNC was created to control another computer remotely. You may know it best for its role in tech support services. Use of VNC is optional. VNC can be used after the WireGuard VPN has been activated to access the watsonx.data server. WireGuard : WireGuard is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted virtual private networks, and was designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface. You will need to install the Wireguard software and download the server VPN certificate in order to access the watsonx.data server.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"wxd-glossary/#glossary","text":"Apache Superset : Apache Superset is an open-source software application for data exploration and data visualization able to handle data at petabyte scale.

The link to the Jupyter Notebook table of contents is provided in your TechZone reservation. When you initially open the link, it will request a password to view the Table of Contents: The default password for the notebook is watsonx.data . Once you enter the password, the Table of Contents will be displayed. There are 11 notebooks provided in the system, and a brief description of the notebooks are found below. Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks If you are not familiar with the use of Jupyter notebooks, this will be a good starting point. To view the notebook, click on the blue arrow found at the bottom of the box. This will open a new tab in your browser with the contents of the notebook. This notebook provides an introduction to what Jupyter Notebooks are and what the common tasks are that you can perform in a notebook. Watsonx.data Credentials This is a key notebook for you to use during your work with the watsonx.data system. This notebook provides details on the userids and passwords for the services that are running in the server. There is no need to use a terminal command line to determine what the credentials are! In addition to the userids and passwords, this notebook provides a convenient way of downloading the certificate required to connect to the Presto database. Simply click on the certificate link and it will be downloaded to your local machine. Presto Magic Commands Magic commands are special macros found in Jupyter notebooks that simplify many tasks, including the ability to run SQL commands against a database. This notebook provides an introduction to what magic commands are and how you can use the Presto magic commands to connect and query the Presto database. Introduction to Presto SQL The watsonx.data lab has two ways of running SQL against the Presto database: Presto CLI commands Python/Pandas/Magic commands This notebook contains all the SQL that is run in the Presto SQL section of the lab. Instead of using the presto-cli command, this notebook uses magic commands to simplify the SQL execution. You can choose either method to explore Presto SQL. Presto Federation Presto provides the ability to federate queries across different servers. This notebook explores the ability to federate a PostgreSQL table with a table found in Presto. This lab requires some knowledge of the watsonx.data UI, so it is recommended you become familiar with the UI before running this lab. Python with watsonx.data Accessing the Presto database in Python requires the use of the prestodb module which implements features of the DBAPI standard. The notebook demonstrates how to connect to the database and retrieve results. Pandas Dataframes with watsonx.data Pandas dataframes are commonly used in Jupyter notebooks to analyze data. This code will connect to Presto using a Pandas dataframe and display some data from an existing table that was created in Presto. Note that the certificate required for this notebook is provided in the environment. Accessing watsonx.data with Spark This notebook demonstrates how Spark can connect to watsonx.data and manipulate the data. This system has a local, minimally configured Spark engine that will be used to access the Presto database. This engine is sufficient to demonstrate the steps needed to connect to watsonx.data and access the data that resides in the Presto catalogs.

Exit from the Sandbox. exit MinIO CLI The MinIO Client mc command line tool provides an alternative to UNIX commands like ls , cat , cp , mirror , and diff with support for both file systems and Amazon S3-compatible cloud storage services. The mc commandline tool is built for compatibility with the AWS S3 API and is tested with MinIO and AWS S3 for expected functionality and behavior. Complete details and restrictions around the use of the CLI command can be found on the MinIO Client page. You can use the MinIO CLI from a variety of clients. The MinIO ports are open in the developer edition image, which provides an alternative to loading data directly from your workstation rather than using the MinIO UI interface. Minio System Alias Before running commands against the MinIO server, an alias must be created that includes the access and secret key. The values can be extracted from the system by listing the contents of the /certs/passwords file or by running the passwords command as the root user. cat /certs/passwords The values for the MinIO access and secret key can also be exported with the following code: export LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') export LH_S3_SECRET_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_SECRET_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') echo \"MinIO Userid : \" $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY echo \"MinIO Password: \" $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY The alias command has the following syntax: mc alias set alias-name hostname:port access_key secret_key For a local connection, we will use the following values: Alias Name - watsonxdata Hostname \u2013 watsonxdata Port \u2013 9000 Access Key \u2013 $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY Secret Key - $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY If you are using an external client to connect to the MinIO service, you will need the URL and Port number from the TechZone reservation. The access key and secret key will be the same values that are found above. Hostname \u2013 region.techzone-server.com Port \u2013 12345 The alias for local access is found below. mc alias set watsonxdata http://watsonxdata:9000 $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY Added `watsonxdata` successfully. List Buckets The mc command provides us with a number of commands that allows us to manage buckets and files within them. The following command checks to see what buckets currently exist in the system. mc ls tree watsonxdata [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B hive-bucket/ [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B iceberg-bucket/ You can view the contents of a bucket by traversing down the path. mc ls tree watsonxdata/hive-bucket [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B gosalesdw/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B hive_sql/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B ontime/ [2023-10-13 10:34:36 EDT] 0B taxi/ Create a Bucket At this point we will create a new bucket to hold some data. Use the mb (make bucket) command. The command requires the alias name for the MinIO connection followed by the name of the bucket. mc mb alias-name/new-bucket The following code will create a new bucket in the system called sampledata . mc mb watsonxdata/sampledata Bucket created successfully `watsonxdata/sampledata`. We can double check that the bucket it there. mc ls tree watsonxdata [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B hive-bucket/ [2023-09-29 14:38:19 EDT] 0B iceberg-bucket/ [2023-10-13 10:39:47 EDT] 0B sampledata/ Loading Data One of the most powerful features of the MinIO CLI is its ability to load data directory from your workstation into the bucket, rather than having to use the MinIO UI. It is also significantly faster than using the UI interface. The next example will load data into the bucket that was just created. The directory that we will be using to load data from is called /sampledata and found in the root directory of the watsonx.data server. ls /sampledata/csv gosales ontime taxi Next we will load the data from each one of these directories into the sampledata bucket. The mc command allows you to select which files to place into a bucket, or an entire directory with recursion. In this case we are loading all three directories the files into the bucket. Note the use of the / at the end of the directory name to prevent the directory name csv from being used as the high-level directory name in the target bucket. mc cp --recursive /sampledata/csv/ watsonxdata/sampledata/ ...data/csv/taxi/taxi.csv: 306.16 MiB / 306.16 MiB \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 147.91 MiB/s 2s We can double-check that our files are there with the --files option: mc tree --files watsonxdata/sampledata/ watsonxdata/sampledata/ \u251c\u2500 gosales \u2502 \u251c\u2500 DIST_INVENTORY_FACT.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 DIST_PRODUCT_FORECAST_FACT.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 DIST_RETURNED_ITEMS_FACT.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 DIST_RETURN_REASON_DIM.csv .... \u2502 \u251c\u2500 EMP_EMPLOYEE_DIM.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 SLS_SALES_TARG_FACT.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 gosales_createtable.sql \u2502 \u2514\u2500 gosales_load_postgres.sql \u251c\u2500 ontime \u2502 \u251c\u2500 aircraft.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 airline_id.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 airport_id.csv \u2502 \u251c\u2500 cancellation.csv \u2502 \u2514\u2500 ontime.csv \u2514\u2500 taxi \u2514\u2500 taxi.csv Delete a File or Bucket Use the rb (Remove bucket) command to remove a bucket and its contents. You can remove individual objects by using the rm (Remove) command by fully qualifying the object. The next command will remove the ontime.csv file from the ontime folder. mc rm watsonxdata/sampledata/ontime/ontime.csv Removed `watsonxdata/sampledata/ontime/ontime.csv`. The delete bucket command will fail if you still have data in the bucket. mc rb watsonxdata/sampledata mc: `watsonxdata/sampledata` is not empty. Retry this command with \u2018--force\u2019 flag if you want to remove `watsonxdata/sampledata` and all its contents Adding the --force option will remove the bucket and all the data in it.

A watsonx.data catalog contains schemas and references a data source via a connector. A connector is like a driver for a database. Watsonx.data connectors are an implementation of Presto\u2019s SPI which allows Presto to interact with a resource. There are several built-in connectors for JMX, Hive, TPCH etc., some of which you will use as part of the labs.

The first thing to consider is whether you need to use the VM Remote Console at all. All the services like the watsonx.data UI, MinIO, Presto, Apache Superset and Portainer, are all web-based servers which means you just need to use your own browser to access these programs. Connecting into the watsonx virtual machine can be done using the secure shell command (ssh) which provides access to all the low-level commands you might need to use like starting the Apache Superset service. Note that Apache Superset is not up and running by default, so you will need to start it before attempting to connect to it. So what's the VM Remote Console required for? One program that has been provided to view the database schemas is dBeaver, a community edition of software that provides a query interface to 100's of data sources, including the watsonx.data environment. You can only use this program using the VM Remote Console. You do have the option of installing this software on your own machine if you wish. Find your email message that contains details of your reservation. Details of what the reservations and the page containing details of the reservation can be found in the Accessing the reservation section.

Select the watsonx user and use watsonx.data as the password. You can open this window in a separate browser window, or place it into fullscreen mode. Note that you may need to increase the size of your browser window (or change the scaling in the browser) to see all the virtual desktop. At this point you have access to the desktop of the watsonx user and can issue commands from within this environment. As mentioned previously, you do not need to use this interface to use the lab. Enabling VNC Access The watsonx.data image has port 5901 exposed for use with VNC browsers. If you want to use VNC instead of the VM Remote Console access, you must do the following: Make sure you are not currently logged in using the VM Virtual Console You have suitable VNC software (Mac OSX includes this). Use RealVNC or UltraVNC on a Windows box. You have a Terminal Shell open to issue root commands In a terminal window, ssh into the watsonx.data virtual machine as the watsonx user. Then you will need to become the root user and issue the following commands: sudo su - systemctl enable vncserver@:1 systemctl start vncserver@:1 systemctl daemon-reload After these commands complete, you will not be able to use the VM Remote Console to connect to the watsonx userid. Instead, you will need to use your VNC software to connect to the server. If at any time you want to turn off VNC support, issue the following commands: sudo su - systemctl disable vncserver@:1 systemctl stop vncserver@:1 systemctl daemon-reload Access watsonx.data on a Mac OSX system Once the VNC service has been started, you can connect to the machine using the VNC service by using the URL provided in your reservation document (sample URL below): VNC Service - vnc://region.techzone-server.com:28314 Use the Mac screen sharing app to connect to watsonx.data. You can connect using the OSX Safari browser by using the URL provided above. It will automatically start the screen sharing application. Note : The VNC URL format is only valid in Safari and may not work in other browsers. When the service connects to the server it will prompt for the password of the watsonx user - watsonx.data .

The developers of this code have additional offerings that they sell for a fee and use advertising on their site to support their work on this and other projects. Because of the way the website has been designed, there are a number of ads and buttons that might distract you from the actual product you want to download.

The examples below assume the IP address of 192.168.252.2 with a port number of 5901 . Before hitting enter, you may want to select the options button and change the setting in Miscellaneous to prevent advertising from being displayed while working with this program. Press connect when done. The password for the service is watsonx. which is watsonx with a period . at the end. At this point you should see the desktop of the virtual machine. You are now connected and can work on the watsonx.data desktop. If you find that performance is sluggish, this may be due to network latency. In the settings toolbar of the UltraVNC window, change the color resolution from Full to 256 . Your screen may look a bit washed out, but this will reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network to render your screen.","title":"Using UltraVNC"},{"location":"wxd-revisions/","text":"Revisions October 6, 2023 Updated the lab to GA 1.0.3 code What's new in watsonx.data version 1.0.3 Image now available in 10 data centers with simpler provisioning Requesting an Image Removed VPN Requirement External URLs and Ports for all UI Services watsonx.data Ports Added PostgreSQL and MySQL databases Postgres Connection MySQL Connection Added Jupyter notebook examples Jupyter Notebook support Fixed Presto certificate to support TechZone addresses without updating /etc/hosts Watsonx.data Connection Certificate Added standalone Spark server to show connectivity to the Presto database Accessing watsonx.data with Spark Added watsonx.data Client code Watsonx.data client utilities Added MinIO CLI interface MinIO CLI Exposed external ports for MinIO, Db2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hive, PrestoDB watsonx.data Ports VNC Interface disabled by default Enabling VNC Access Added Ingesting data chapter Ingesting Data July 25, 2023 Updated the lab to GA 1.0.1 code Automated start of watsonx.data and simplification of many of the sections Removed the Ingest section until a new version is available Added Db2 and PostgreSQL connection details June 12, 2023 Clarified some commands and added an Appendix on common issues.

Here is a list of common questions, problems, and potential solutions. What are the passwords for the services I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole A SQL Statement failed but there are no error messages Apache Superset isn't Starting Apache Superset screens differ from the lab Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked Presto doesn't appear to be working Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Queries are failing with a 400 code Queries are failing with a 200 or 500 code Queries are failing with memory errors SSH, VNC and watsonx.data UI are not working No access to Presto/Minio UI after restart Firefox and Chrome freeze when connecting to MinIO What are the passwords for the services? See the section on Passwords . You can get all passwords for the system when you are logged in as the watsonx user by using the following command. cat /certs/passwords You can also use the Jupyter notebook link to display the userids and passwords for the services. I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole First thing to remember is that you can't use VNC and the TechZone VM Remote Console (Guacamole) interface at the same time. Only one can be active at a time. If you can't use terminal windows in VNC If you find that the terminal icons \"spins\" inside the VNC window, this is caused by attempting to connect to the virtual machine by using the VM Remote Console button in your reservation details screen. To fix this problem, you must log out of the VNC session (top right corner of the Linux desktop - press the power button and choose logout). Once VNC logs back in you will be able use the terminal window. A SQL Statement failed, but there are no error messages You need to use the Presto console and search for the SQL statement. Click on the Query ID to find more details of the statement execution and scroll to the bottom of the web page to see any error details. Apache Superset isn't Starting If Superset doesn't start for some reason, you will need to reset it completely to try it again. First make sure you are connected as the watsonx user not root . Make sure you have stopped the terminal session that is running Apache Superset. Next remove the Apache Superset directory. sudo rm -rf /home/watsonx/superset We remove the docker images associated with Apache Superset. If no containers or volumes exist you will get an error message. docker ps -a -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker container rm --force docker volume list -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker volume rm --force Download the superset code again. git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git The docker-compose-non-dev.yml file needs to be updated so that Apache Superset can access the same network that watsonx.data is using. cd ./superset cp docker-compose-non-dev.yml docker-compose-non-dev-backup.yml sed '/version: \"3.7\"/q' docker-compose-non-dev.yml > yamlfix.txt cat <<EOF >> yamlfix.txt networks: default: external: True name: ibm-lh-network EOF sed -e '1,/version: \"3.7\"/ d' docker-compose-non-dev.yml >> yamlfix.txt We update the Apache Superset code to version 2.1.0 . sed 's/\\${TAG:-latest-dev}/2.1.0/' yamlfix.txt > docker-compose-non-dev.yml Use docker-compose to start Apache Superset. nohup docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up & The nohup command will issue a message indicating that output will be directed to the nohup.out file. It takes some time for the service to start, so be patient! You can view any output from the Apache Superset system by viewing the nohup.out file in the directory where you installed superset. Apache Superset screens differ from the lab The Apache Superset project makes frequent changes to the types of charts that are available. In some cases they remove or merge charts. Since these charts changes are dynamic, we are not able to guarantee that our examples will look the same as what you might have on your system. Presto doesn't appear to be working If you find that the watsonx.data UI is generating error messages that suggest that queries are not running, or that the Presto service is dead, you can force a soft restart of Presto with the following command: docker restart ibm-lh-presto This will restart the Presto server. If you find that does not fix your problem, you will need to do a hard reset using the following commands: sudo su - cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop_service ibm-lh-presto ./start_service ibm-lh-presto check_presto The command will wait until the service is running before exiting. Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Occasionally when attempting to expand the Db2 catalog (schema), the watsonx.data UI will not display any data or issue an error message. You can try refreshing the browser (not the refresh icon inside the UI) and try again. If you find that this is failing again, open the Query workspace and run the following SQL (replace db2_gosales with the name you cataloged the database with). select count(*) from db2_gosales.gosalesdw.go_org_dim The result should be 123 and hopefully the tables that are part of the schema will display for you. Queries are failing with a 400 code The watsonx.data UI will log you out after a period of inactivity, but doesn't tell you that this has happened. When you attempt to run a query, the error that is returned (400) indicates that you need to log back in again. Queries are failing with a 200 or 500 code A 500 code may indicate the watsonx.data UI has a problem connecting with the Presto engine. First log out of the console and trying logging back on. If that fails to solve the problem, you will need to reboot the console. Open up a terminal window into the server: As the root user, restart the docker container that is running the watsonx.data UI. docker restart lhconsole-nodeclient-svc Queries fail become of insufficient memory If you are running a complex query, you may get an error message similar to \"Query exceeded per-node user memory limit\" or a something similar. Watsonx.data (Presto) attempts to limit the amount of resources being using in a query and will stop a query if it exceeds a certain threshold. You can change the behavior of the system by making the following changes. Note : During this step you will disconnect anyone running a query on the server. What you need to do is make a change to the configuration settings of the Presto engine. AS the root user, enter the docker container for the presto engine: docker exec -it ibm-lh-presto /bin/bash Next, copy the original config file to a safe place in case we make an error: cp /opt/presto/etc/config.properties /opt/presto/etc/config.properties.backup Then update the properties file. cat >> /opt/presto/etc/config.properties << EOL experimental.spiller-spill-path=/tmp experimental.spiller-max-used-space-threshold=0.7 experimental.max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.query-max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.spill-enabled=true query.max-memory=10GB query.max-memory-per-node=10GB query.max-total-memory-per-node=10GB query.max-total-memory=10GB EOL Doublecheck that it worked. cat /opt/presto/etc/config.properties | grep experimental experimental.max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.query-max-spill-per-node=10GB experimental.spill-enabled=true experimental.spiller-max-used-space-threshold=0.7 experimental.spiller-spill-path=/tmp If it is all good then exit the container. exit And now we restart the container. Make sure that you don't impact other users! docker restart ibm-lh-presto Now try running your query again. Note : Once you make this change, only restart presto using the above command, otherwise you will lose the changes. Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked from connecting If you lock yourself out of VNC because of too many incorrect logins, you can reset the service with the following commands. Connect as the root user then run the following command and you should be able to log in again. systemctl restart vncserver@:1 exit SSH, VNC and watsonx.data UI are not working Symptoms: You've tried to use SSH to log into the system, and you get a timeout error. All the Web-based UIs (watsonx.data UI, Presto) fail. Find your email message that contains details of your reservation. Details of what the reservations and the page containing details of the reservation can be found in the Accessing the reservation section. Once the details appear, scroll down to the bottom of the web page, and you will see the VM Remote Console button. You can access the logon screen of the virtual machine by pressing the VM Remote Console button. Clicking on this button will display the logon screen for the server. If you see this screen, the system is running and there is something wrong the watsonx.data service (see instructions below). If you see the following screen: This means your server has been turned off. Click on the Power on button. Make sure to press the Yes button to turn the power on! In a few minutes you should see the logon screen again. Wait for a few minutes for all the services to start, and then you will be able to use SSH, VNC, and watsonx.data UI. Reset watsonx.data If you can log into the watsonx userid using the VM Remove console, you can reset the watsonx.data server with the following steps. SSH into the server as the root user. Then switch to the development code bin directory. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin Check the status of the system with the following command. ./status.sh --all Output will look similar to: using /root/ibm-lh-dev/localstorage/volumes as data root directory for user: root/1001 infra config location is /root/ibm-lh-dev/localstorage/volumes/infra lhconsole-ui running 0.0.0.0:9443->8443/tcp, :::9443->8443/tcp lhconsole-nodeclient-svc running 3001/tcp lhconsole-javaapi-svc running 8090/tcp lhconsole-api running 3333/tcp, 8081/tcp ibm-lh-presto running 0.0.0.0:8443->8443/tcp, :::8443->8443/tcp ibm-lh-hive-metastore running ibm-lh-postgres running 5432/tcp ibm-lh-minio running If the any of the services are not running, you will need to restart the system with the following set of commands. cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop.sh export LH_RUN_MODE=diag ./start.sh Wait for all services to start and then check to see if you can connect to the watsonx.data UI. No access to Presto/Minio UI after restart If you are using a TechZone image that has been suspended, or restarted, you may come across a situation where you are unable to connect to any service that uses the http protocol. The watsonx.service needs to have a diagnostic flag set that opens up these ports, and sometimes this diagnostic setting is not being updated. To manually stop and start the system, you will need to connect with root user privileges and run the following commands: sudo su - cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin ./stop.sh export LH_RUN_MODE=diag ./start.sh This set of commands will stop all the services in watsonx.data and restart them in diagnostic mode. This will now open the http ports for use. Firefox and Chrome freeze when connecting to MinIO Firefox and Chrome on OSX will occasionally freeze when connecting to the MinIO console. The Safari browser is much more reliable. This problem appears to be caused by some features which are not properly handled by these browsers.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"wxd-troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-watsonxdata","text":"Although we have tried to make the lab as error-free as possible, occasionally things will go wrong.

Using External Ports with VMware/Virtual Box The labs assume that you are using a browser \"within\" your virtual machine console. However, both VMware and VirtualBox provide a method for accessing the ports on the virtual machine in your local environment. VMware For VMware, the easiest way to connect to the virtual machine from your host machine is to use the ifconfig command to determine your virtual machine IP address. ifconfig Search for an ensxx** value in the output from the command. There you should see the inet address of your virtual machine ( 172.16.210.237 ). To access the Portainer application from your local browser, you would use this address followed by the Portainer PORT number: https://172.16.210.237:6443 . Remember that inside your virtual machine, you will be using https://localhost:6443 . The following PORT numbers are open in the machine: 9443 - IBM watsonx.data management console 8080 - Presto console 9001 - MinIO console (S3 buckets) 6443 - Portainer (Docker container management) 8088 - Apache Superset (Query and Graphing) 5901 - VNC Access (Access to GUI in the machine) 7681 - SSH (Terminal access) via Browser 22 - SSH (Terminal access) via local terminal program 8443 - Presto External Port (dBeaver connection) 5432 - Postgres External Port (dBeaver connection) VirtualBox VirtualBox does not externalize the IP address of the virtual machine. The ifconfig command will provide an IP address of the machine, but it will not be reachable from your host browser. To open the ports, you must use the network option on the virtual machine. This step can be done while the machine is running. From the VirtualBox console, choose Settings for the machine and then click on the Network option. Press the Advanced option near the bottom of the dialog. Select the Port Forwarding button. This will display the port forwarding menu. You must place an entry for each port that we want to externalize to the host machine. If the value for Host IP is empty (blank), it defaults to localhost. In the example above, the 5901 port in the Guest machine (watsonxdata) is mapped to the host machines 5901 port. To access VNC, you would use localhost:5901 . If the guest machine port conflicts with the host machine port number, you can use a different port number. Terminal Command Window All the commands in the lab will require you execute commands in a terminal window. In addition, the labs require access to the root userid, and this can be accomplished in two ways that are described below. Local Terminal Shell Use a local terminal shell (iterm, Hyper, terminal) and use the SSH command to shell into the machine. For the VMware image, you need to know the IP address of the image and the port number that has been exposed for SSH command (default is 22). Assuming that your VMware machine has an IP address of 172.16.210.237 , the command to SSH into the machine would be: ssh watsonx@172.16.210.237 You will need to accept the unknown host warning and then provide the password for the watsonx userid: watsonx.data . At this point you are connected as the watsonx user. To become the root user, you must enter the following command in the terminal window. sudo su - Now as the root user you will be ready to run the commands found in the lab. Terminal Window in Virtual Machine You can use the Terminal application in the virtual machine to issue commands. This will open up the terminal window. At this point you are connected as the watsonx user. You can ignore any lab instructions that ask you to ssh into the watsonx server. To become the root user, you must enter the following command in the terminal window. sudo su - Now as the root user you will be ready to run the commands found in the lab.","title":"VMWare Image"},{"location":"wxd-vmware/#ibm-watsonxdata-vmware-image","text":"The IBM watsonx.data lab can be run in a virtual machine environment using VMWare Workstation, VMWare Fusion, or Oracle VirtualBox.

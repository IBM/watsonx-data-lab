# Chicago Taxi Data

Taxi trips are reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number.

The data set used in this system contains records from January 1st, 2013 and does not include the census tract value nor the Taxi ID.
